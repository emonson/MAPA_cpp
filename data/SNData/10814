 Science Talent Search future

by J.A. Miller

 After CBS Corp. absorbed Westinghouse Electric Corp. last month, thoughts of 
science educators and students around the country turned to the Science Talent 
Search (STS). For 57 years, the contest funded by Westinghouse and administered 
by Science Service has honored and provided scholarships to thousands of high 
school students.

 The Westinghouse Foundation is providing funds for the STS through 1999, says 
Thomas Peter Bennett, president of Science Service. "Since Science Service is 
committed to ensuring the continuation of the STS, we are currently engaged in 
conversations with several prospective corporate sponsors," he adds. "This 
year's competition will be unaffected by changes at Westinghouse." 

 The 300 semifinalists for the 1998 STS will be notified next week, and the 40 
finalists will be announced January 27.

 Five STS winners have gone on to win Nobel prizes, two have received Fields 
Medals in mathematics, and three have garnered National Medals of Science. 
Thirty have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and four to the 
National Academy of Engineering. 

 Science Service, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to advance 
public understanding and appreciation of science, publishes Science News.
