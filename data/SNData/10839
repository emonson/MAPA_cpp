 Fishing trawlers scrape rock bottom

 By S. Simpson 

 Fishing boats in search of shrimp, flounder, and other bottom-dwelling seafood 
delicacies drag heavily weighted nets along the seafloor. Creatures not snared 
are crushed, buried, or exposed to predators. Marine researchers now say such 
trawling worldwide destroys a seabed area twice the size of the contiguous 
United States each year.

"Nobody had a clue that it was nearly this extensive," says Elliott A. Norse of 
the Marine Conservation Biology Institute in Redmond, Wash. The complete damage 
report appears in a suite of articles in the December Conservation Biology.

 Norse had long suspected that damage from bottom trawling is in the ballpark 
with that from clear-cutting forests on land (SN: 10/26/96, p. 268), but his 
new calculations show that it's 150 times more widespread. Logging flattens an 
area about the size of Indiana yearly.

 Since the 1970s, new technology has allowed fishing fleets to trawl deeper. 
Not adapted to storm waves and other trials of shallow-water life, creatures in 
deep waters take longer to grow and recolonize than their near-shore relatives. 
Norse predicts that the deepest areas of the trawled seafloor may take as long 
as clear-cut forests to recover-from decades to centuries.

 Skeptics point out that such estimates stem from incomplete research. "While 
we know species diversity from the trawl area drops, other species tend to 
thrive afterward," says Scott Smullen of the National Marine Fisheries Service 
in Silver Spring, Md. Smullen says that before sounding an alarm, his agency is 
trying to find out more about trawling's long-term effects on fish habitat. 
Norse and others are pushing to set aside areas for immediate protection.
