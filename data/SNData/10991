 Here come the Leonids 

 By R. Cowen

 Attention, skywatchers.

 That annual fall light show, the Leonid meteor shower, returns the night of 
Nov. 17, and some astronomers have suggested that this year's event could be 
quite a spectacle. The shower takes place every November, when Earth passes 
through a stream of debris shed by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle (SN: 10/31/98, p. 
280).

 Every 33 years or so, when the comet passes close by, Earth encounters an 
especially dense part of the debris stream. Observers then see a heavy shower 
or even a storm, when more than 1,000 meteors streak across the sky in less 
than an hour.

 Earth last witnessed a Leonid storm in 1966. A team of British and Australian 
astronomers has predicted a moderately good show for this year and 
next-stronger than in 1998-but they say the real McCoy won't occur until 2001 
and 2002. Other astronomers doubt such forecasts.

 Although Europe and Africa may have ringside seats this year, North America, 
especially the East Coast, could also witness some fireworks. Start gazing 
eastward around midnight, when the constellation Leo rises. Viewing might 
improve after the moon sets, but activity may have dwindled by then.
