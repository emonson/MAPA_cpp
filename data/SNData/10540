 Laser beam triggers a membrane breach

by I. Peterson

 The cell membrane serves as a tough, flexible barrier that protects a cell 
from its environment and holds in its components. Composed largely of fat 
molecules called lipids, this thin skin offers tremendous resistance to rupture 
and normally doesn't allow internal structures to pop out.

 Researchers have now demonstrated that a low-power laser beam focused on an 
artificial structure that mimics a cell membrane can trigger the spontaneous 
ejection of material inside without permanently damaging either the membrane or 
the expelled object.

 Physicists J. David Moroz and Philip Nelson of the University of Pennsylvania 
in Philadelphia and Roy Bar-Ziv and Elisha Moses of the Weizmann Institute of 
Science in Rehovot, Israel, report their findings in an article to be published 
in Physical Review Letters.

 The technique is a new way of selectively disrupting membranes, the 
researchers say. The ability to induce expulsion "hints at the exciting 
practical possibility of transforming membrane structure when and where we wish 
to do so."

 In water, lipid molecules spontaneously assemble themselves into closed, 
saclike structures, or vesicles, analogous to cells. One vesicle can form 
inside another.

 Focused on a lipid membrane, a laser beam's electromagnetic field induces 
molecular changes that tighten the membrane, increasing internal pressure. The 
disturbance causes the system to act as a pump, pulling water in by osmosis and 
forcing internal material out. When a vesicle floating within the sac 
encounters the outer wall, it sticks. Within a few seconds, it begins to 
emerge, gradually passing through the outer membrane.
