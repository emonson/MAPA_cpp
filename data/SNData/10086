 Cloned pigs, down on the corporate farm

 John Travis

 Dozing on a farm in Blacksburg, Va., are Alexis, Carrel, Christa, Dotcom, and 
Millie, the first pigs ever cloned from the cells of an adult swine. The 
corporate parent of the litter is PPL Therapeutics of Edinburgh, Scotland, the 
same firm that funded the creation of Dolly, the cloned sheep (SN: 3/1/97, p. 
132: ).

 Hoping to attract investors, company officials announced their latest feat 
before submitting the research to a scientific journal. Cloning pigs is the 
first step in the plans of PPL Therapeutics to genetically engineer swine whose 
organs can be transplanted into people (SN: 11/4/95, p. 298: ).

 In particular, the company wants to create pigs from cells in which it has 
deactivated the gene for an enzyme that places certain sugar molecules on the 
surface of every swine cell. Because people don't make this sugar molecule, the 
human immune system normally attacks pig cells sporting it.
