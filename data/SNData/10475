 Solar series wins award for Science News

 Julie Ann Miller

 The sun is shining on Science News this week. In Albuquerque, the Solar 
Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society has awarded its 
2002 Popular Writing Award for journalists to Ron Cowen and Sid Perkins for a 
two-part series in Science News.

 Ron's article "Stormy Weather" () focuses on cyclic variations in the sun's 
activity and describes solar storms, which can disrupt 
communications and power networks on Earth, threaten high-altitude flight 
crews, and cause the beautiful aurora. Ron has written about 
astronomy for Science News for more than 11 years.

 In "Pinning Down the Sun-Climate Connection" (), Sid tackles the difficult 
task of disentangling solar and earthly effects on Earth's 
climate, addressing phenomena-temperature, rainfall, forest fires, and 
hurricanes-that seem to follow the sun's 11-year activity cycle. Sid 
has covered earth sciences for Science News for 2 years.
