KMeansRex : Fast C++ implementation of K-Means using the Eigen matrix template library, with hooks to Matlab and Python/Numpy

This toolbox is meant to be the tyrant lizard king of k-means implementations. It is at least 2x as fast as the native kmeans implementations provided by matlab and scipy. It provides smart modern (kmeans plus plus) initialization as a default. Code is fully vectorized using the excellent Eigen matrix template library.

Matlab Usage [after compiling MEX file]:
  >> X = rand( 1000, 5)
  >> [Mu,Z] = KMeansRex( X, 3 );
  
Python Usage:
  >> import numpy as np;
  >> import KMeansRex
  >> X = np.random.rand( 1000,5)
  >> Mu,Z = KMeansRex.RunKMeans( X, 3);

Compiling:
* Build the shared library libkmeansrex.so from KMeansRexCore.cpp [use optim flags for best performance]
    g++ --shared -o libkmeansrex.so KMeansRexCore.cpp -I/path/to/eigen/ -O3 -DNDEBUG

* [Matlab Only] Build the KMeansRex mex executable from source
    mex KMeansRex.cpp ./libkmeansrex.so -I/path/to/eigen

Dependencies:
* Eigen Matrix Template Library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
